# subModelInModel
Qt example of using a Model within a Model - to have at example a list of Pages with a ListView on each

It works based on QQmlObjectListModel by https://github.com/Cavewhere
The qqmlhelpers.h and qqmlobjectlistmodel.h Files are taken from https://github.com/Cavewhere/lib-qt-qml-tricks

Make good use of it!
